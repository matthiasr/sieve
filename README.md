sieve
=====

Starting from a university course a long long time ago I am using the [Sieve of Erathostenes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) as the Kata to get a feeling for a new programming languages.

This is a collection of these, of varying detail, quality and age. This is not a complete collection, many have been lost to the mists of time.
